\title{Estimate single-case design}
\usage{
estimateSC(data, dvar, pvar, mvar, s = NULL, rtt = NULL,
  model = "JW", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A single-case data frame. See \code{\link{scdf}} to learn about
this format.}

\item{dvar}{Character string with the name of the dependent variable. Defaults to the attributes in the scdf file.}

\item{pvar}{Character string with the name of the phase variable. Defaults to the attributes in the scdf file.}

\item{mvar}{Character string with the name of the measurement time variable. Defaults to the attributes in the scdf file.}

\item{s}{The standard deviation depcting the between case variance of the overall performance. If more than two single-cases are included in the scdf, the variance is estimated if s is set to NULL.}

\item{rtt}{The reliability of the measurements. The reliability is estimated when rtt = NULL.}

\item{model}{Model for calculating the interaction term.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to the lm function.}
}
\value{
A list of parameters for each single-case. Parameters include name, length, and starting measurementtime of each phase, trend level, and slope effects for each phase, mean, standarddeviation, and reliability for each case.
}
\description{
This functions takes an scdf an extracts design parameters. The resulting in
object can be unsed to randomly create new scdf files with the same
underlying parameters. This might be usefull for monte-carlo stdies and
bootstrapping procedures.
